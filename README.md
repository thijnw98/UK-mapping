Google UK city to region mapping: Assigning UK cities to regions in GA.

### Use case: 
I monitor a number of UK-sites and sometimes get asked by clients for regional data (ie. South West, Midlands, North East etc.) so that they can see a percentage of which part of the country are interacting the most/least as this helps them understand where to increase their marketing budget.

However, 'GA' only shows four regions (England, Wales, Scotland, N.Ireland) or 'Town/City' which gives me a list of about 700 towns and cities. Using chatGPT I made a mapping assigning each town/city to a region. I manually checked over 100 biggest cities which must be correct now, but ChatGPT is not always 100 certain (2% mistakes in op100) so if there are any mistakes, please let me know. Also, I added only the towns/cities which occurred in my data set, there might be some small towns where no conversion for my client was recorded, so which is not in the data.
